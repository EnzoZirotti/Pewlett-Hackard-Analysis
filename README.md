# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

### Overview of the analysis:
 In this deliverable we determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then to write a report that summarizes analysis and helps prepare the manager for the massive amount of retirees.
  
## Results:
I have found that the results show a gross amount of retirees that will occer.
 
 -There are 72,458 employees who's birthdates are betweden 1952 and 1956. 
  
 -There are 25,916 Senior Engineers. 
  
 -There are 24,926 Senior Staff.
  
 -9,285 Engineers.
  
 -7,636 Staff.
  
 -3,603 Technique Leaders.
  
 -1,090 Assistant Engineers.
  
 -2 Managers.

## Summary:

In this analysis we can see that we will have 72,458 that will be needed to fill as the impact of retirees to come will hit.
There is also a lack of retirement ready employees that are able to mentor the next generation off Pewlett Hackared employees.
I would suggest to impliment a start of training for the retirement ready employees to counter balance the underwhelming amount of mentors in the field.


I also want to go on and explain that in the deliverable 2 code that I had used to find the mentorship_elegibility was not as accurate as the one I had found.

The reason I had used de.to_date was because the teachers assistant had told me that this is the way I should have done it. However the code I show above more accurately shows the most resent job they are having since I am going directly off of the titles column.
